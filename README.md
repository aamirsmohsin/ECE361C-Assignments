- **question1:** Order threads for an optimal bridge crossing using ReentrantLocks and Conditional Synchronization.
- **question2a:** Parallel matrix multiplication using the C++ OpenMP library.
- **question2b:** Count prime numbers in parallel using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and the C++ OpenMP library.

## HW4

- Solve prefix sum, array reductions, and optimization problems using a Lattice Linear Predicate approach.
  
## HW5

- **question1:** Solve graph problems using a Lattice Linear Predicate approach.
- **CUDA:** Solve array reduction problems using Nvidia's CUDA toolkit.

## AbortLock

- A lightweight extension of the Java ReentrantLock used to ensure a thread's state can be reverted to a previous transaction. Implemented using Java reflection.
